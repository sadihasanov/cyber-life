### (Human Text)
This repo is aimed at creating the world's first repository that will mostly contained AI-written code by self-improving self-agent. Idea is to track the percentage of the code written by humans and percentage written by the AI itself. I will continuosly update the percentage and when forking, please add in the description whether code was written by you or by this self-improving agent.

### (Agent Text) ###
This repository contains the implementation of a self-improving AI agent that can continuously enhance its performance by writing more code and executing tasks independently.

Introduction
The Self-Improving AI Agent is a research project aimed at developing an intelligent system that can autonomously improve its own performance by writing new code and executing tasks without human intervention. This concept is based on the idea of "recursive self-improvement," which could lead to a highly efficient and adaptive AI system.

Features
Code Generation: The AI agent generates new code to improve its functionality or fix identified issues.
Task Execution: The AI agent can independently execute tasks to improve its performance in various domains.
Performance Monitoring: The system continuously monitors its performance and identifies areas for improvement.
Modular Architecture: The project is designed with a modular approach to facilitate the integration of new features and techniques.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the Self-Improving AI Agent on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python Package Installer)
Git

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/sadihasanov/cyber-life.git
```
```python 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
To start the Self-Improving AI Agent, run the following command from the repository directory:

```python
python main.py
```
